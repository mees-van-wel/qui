## Inspiration

Our components draw inspiration from the [Mantine React component library](https://mantine.dev/), a testament to the power and flexibility of modern UI component design. We give full credit to Mantine for paving the way in this domain and providing a solid foundation of ideas and principles that have influenced the development of qUI.

## Philosophy

Despite the growing popularity of headless component libraries, we firmly believe in providing a fully customizable yet comprehensive solution. qUI is not just another headless UI library; it's a full-fledged toolkit designed to empower developers to build beautiful, efficient, and accessible web applications without compromising on control or customizability.

## Intrinsic Props Support

One of the standout features of qUI is its support for intrinsic props, allowing you to customize every component and its sub-elements using the native intrinsic properties of the HTML elements themselves. This approach ensures a high degree of flexibility and adaptability to various design requirements.

## Beta Release and Documentation

Please note that qUI is currently in beta. We are actively working on improving the library and its components. Comprehensive documentation is on our to-do list and will be available soon. Your feedback and contributions during this phase are invaluable and greatly appreciated.
